<p>Our quiz allows users to select a few characteristics and prefrences that match them to a compatible dog breed. 

Our adoption page features resources to locate dogs that need loving homes.

We have featured a shelter finder and a breed list to educate our users about the different breed possibilities they could adopt as well as where to find these amazing dogs.
