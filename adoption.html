                                    shelters. You will make their lives better and your home will be filled with an
                                    unmatched abundance of love. Watch the video below to
                                    see how grateful this pup was to finally go home!</p>

                                <p>Bringing home a new pet is incredibly exciting. And adopting a pet from a shelter or
                                    rescue group is not only exciting, but it’s truly a feel-good experience as well.
                                    Every day, more than 1,700 dogs and cats are killed
                                    in America’s shelters simply because they don’t have safe places to call home. By
                                    adopting, it means that each time you look into your pet’s eyes, you can feel good
                                    knowing that you truly did save a life.</p>
                                <p>Adopting pets has become more and more popular and accessible, and there are now many
                                    different ways to find the right adoptable pet for your family. City and county
                                    animal shelters, nonprofit shelters and rescue groups
                                    are full of pets who lost their homes for any number of reasons.</p>
                                <p>The most common reasons pets end up homeless are: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Moving</li>
                                    <li>Divorce</li>
                                    <li>People losing a home or job</li>
                                    <li>Unplanned litters due to pets not being spayed or neutered</li>
                                    <li>People feeling they no longer have enough time or desire to properly care for a
                                        pet</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Because of these reasons, right now there are hundreds of great pets at shelters and
                                    with rescue groups waiting for someone to choose them. That’s why adopting an animal
                                    is the best way to add a new pet to your family.</p>
